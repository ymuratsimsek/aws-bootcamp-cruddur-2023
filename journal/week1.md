# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

##  Homework Challenges
   1. **Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script:**
       
         ![RunCMDasScript](assets/week-1-Murat-RunCMDasScript.png)

   2. **Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier):**
   
         - **Build with Tag:**
         ![DockerHub1](assets/week-1-Murat-Push1.png)
         
         - **List Images:**
         ![DockerHub2](assets/week-1-Murat-Push2.png)
         
         - **Push Images to Dockerhub:**
         ![DockerHub3](assets/week-1-Murat-Push3.png)
         
         - [Docker Hub Url](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ymsimsek/backend_flask/general)
         
            ![DockerHub4](assets/week-1-Murat-Push4.png) 
         
   3. **Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build:**
         
         To keep the size of docker images small as:
             1. Smaller images are pulled/pushed faster
             2. Smaller images take up less disk space
             The simplest case is a compiler image and a runtime image: the compiler image compiles the code, and the runtime image copies the resulting artifact over. The runtime image never includes the compiler layer, and can therefore be smaller in size.

   4. **Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file:**
                  
         - I have implemented the healthchecks by using docker compose file. Such as:
         
            [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/)
            ```shell
             healthcheck:
             test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:4567/api/health"]
             interval: 5s
             timeout: 10s
             retries: 3
             start_period: 40s
            ```
         - To make a `curl` request, I had to update the backed-end docker file to install the curl. 
             ```shell
             apt-get install -y curl
             ```
         - I developed a new simple healthcheck api for the backend-flask and used it with docker compose health check settings
              ```python
              @app.route("/api/health", methods=['GET'])
              ```
              ![HealtChecker](assets/week-1-Murat-NewHealthCheckApi.png)

         - As seen in the screenshot, I can monitor the statuses of the backend, frontend and PostgreSQL containers.
             
              - I tried to make the health checker of Dynamodb healthy but I could not. I spent too much time thats why I did not create custom docker image for dynamodb to make a custom health check.
              
              ![HealtChecker](assets/week-1-Murat-DockerHealthCheckResult.png)
                 
         - How can we check if the containers are healtly?
            ```
            docker ps
            ```
         - How can we check the logs of health checker?
           ```
            docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' <container id>
            ```
         
   5. **Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile:**
         
         [BestPractices](Best practices for writing Dockerfiles)

   6. **Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces:**
         
         - I have installed Grafana, Prometheus, Node Exporter, Grok Exporter and Push gateway for my local Observability&Monitoring.

   7. **Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes:**
         
         - I installed and configure EC2 and docker via AWS CLI
            1. I created security group via AWS CLI
   
               ![](assets/week-1-Murat-LaunchEc2Docker1.png)
               ![](assets/week-1-Murat-LaunchEc2Docker2.png)

            2. I authorized security group ingress via AWS CLI

               ![](assets/week-1-Murat-LaunchEc2Docker2.png)

            3. I created "cli" folder at Github under "aws" folder and added all cli scripts.
            
               [CLI Scripts](https://github.com/ymuratsimsek/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/tree/main/aws/cli)

               ![](assets/week-1-Murat-LaunchEc2Docker9.png)
            
            4. I installed Docker and started the backend application (pulling the image from DockerHub) during launch of EC2 instance by executing the script at userdata               
                ```bash
                   #!/bin/sh
                   export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH;
                   yum update
                   yum install docker -y
                   sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
                   sudo systemctl enable docker.service
                   sudo systemctl start docker.service
                   sudo docker pull ymsimsek/backend_flask:v1
                   sudo docker run --rm -p 4567:4567 -e FRONTEND_URL='*' -e BACKEND_URL='*' -d ymsimsek/backend_flask:v1
                ```

            3. I created EC2 security group ingress via AWS CLI
            3. I created EC2 security group ingress via AWS CLI
            3. I created EC2 security group ingress via AWS CLI
