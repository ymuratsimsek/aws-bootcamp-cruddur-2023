# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

##  Homework Challenges
   1. **Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend[HARD]:**
         
         I followed the [Honeycomb Doc](https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/opentelemetry/browser-js/) to complete this task.

         - **HeatMap Durations by Url and Root Name:**

         - **UI/Messages:**

         - **UI/Notifications:**

         - **API/Messages:**

         - **API/Activities:**

   2. **Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span:**
   
         - I have added instrumentations to all services except my custom health check api.               
         
         - I have fixed the class name of data_show_activity to test the instrumentation I added.
        
            ```python
              data = ShowActivities.run(activity_uuid=activity_uuid)
            ```
         - **Honecomb Search Graph:**

         - **CreateActivitiy Spans:**

         - **MessageGroups Spans:**

         - **Message Spans:**

         - **Notifications Spans:**

         - **ShowActivities Spans:**

         - **UserActivities Spans:**

   3. **Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces:**

         - **Total Call Count of Frontend by Pages:**

         - **Total Call Count of APIs by Api Url, Method and Http Status Code:**

         - **Performance(%) of API Calls by API:**

         - **HTTP Calls Longer Than 100ms:**
